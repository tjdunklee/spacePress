// The jQuery library included with WordPress is set to the noConflict() mode 
// (see wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js). This is to prevent compatibility
// problems with other JavaScript libraries that WordPress can link.
// In the noConflict() mode, the global $ shortcut for jQuery is not available,
// so you can still use:

jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
  // Some javascript will go in here.
});
